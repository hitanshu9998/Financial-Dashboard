**About**
This Power BI dashboard provides a summary of a bank's loan report. The dashboard includes KPIs (key performance indicators) such as total loan applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. It also segments these KPIs by month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) to provide insights into trends over time.
The dashboard also includes a breakdown of good loans vs bad loans. Good loans are defined as loans that have been fully paid off. Bad loans are defined as loans that have been charged off. The dashboard provides the number of applications, the amount funded, and the amount received for both good and bad loans.
Finally, the dashboard allows you to drill down into the data by loan status and term. 
You can see the total amount received for each loan status (fully paid, charged off, current) and the total amount received for each loan term (in months).
